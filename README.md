# EtGDeckManager
Deck managing software for Elements the Game.

EtGDeckManager is a quick and easy way to save all of your decks locally. 
Some features require an internet connection, such as using the "View Deck" button which queries http://dek.im/ for the deck's image.

Special thanks to Elements forum member and Administrator Antiaverage for developing the extremely helpful http://dek.im which this program uses for some features.

Acknowledgment to Xenocidious for creating the first Deck Manager for Elements the Game <http://elementscommunity.org/forum/elements-tools/the-deck-manager-2-0/>

EtGDeckManager uses libraries from Google's open source GSON project.
