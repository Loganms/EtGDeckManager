# EtGDeckManager
Deck managing software for Elements the Game.

EtGDeckManager is a quick and easy way to save all of your decks locally. 
Some features require an internet connection, such as using the "View Deck" button which queries http://dek.im/ for the deck's image.

EtGDeckManager comes with a default cfg.JSON file but is not required. Any changes made within the program will be reflected in the cfg.JSON file. If you are starting without a cfg.JSON file, access File>New>Deck Binder in order to create your first deck binder. Deck binders group decks together for organization. You can have as many deck binders as you like, each with their own names. To begin saving decks, simply click the "add new deck" option inside of the newly created deck binder; you will be prompted for a name and import code. Only a name is required to create a new deck.

Hovering over any of the buttons or components will give a short description of their feature. The buttons labeled "R" and "D" to the right of the deck binder's name refer to renaming and deleting that specific deck binder. Deleting a deck binder means deleting all deck information stored within that deck binder. All of the buttons on the right side of the Deck Manager represent options relating to the currently selected deck, which can be seen towards the upper-right corner. For example, the "Copy Code" button will copy the currently selected deck's import code into your system's clipboard, ready for you to then paste that code into Elements the Game.

Special thanks to Elements forum member and Administrator Antiaverage for developing the extremely helpful http://dek.im which this program uses for some features.
