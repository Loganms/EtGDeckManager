# EtGDeckManager
Deck managing software for Elements the Game.

EtGDeckManager is a quick and easy way to save all of your decks locally. Some features require an internet connection, such as using the "View Deck" button which queries "http://dek.im/..." for each deck's individual picture.
EtGDeckManager uses libraries from Google's open source GSON project.
